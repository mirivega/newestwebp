As a ballroom dancer and an avid photographer and videographer inspired by cinema, I bring energy and artistry to all my pursuits. I am currently studying Information Systems, combining my love for math with technology to develop innovative solutions. In addition, I work in the Office of Belonging and contribute to a free legal clinic hosted by BYU's law school, where I support efforts to foster inclusion and provide meaningful community service. </p>
